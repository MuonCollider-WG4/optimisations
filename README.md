# solenoid_optics

field_models: set of python classes that contain a bunch of field models

evolve: routines to calculate matched beta function through a lattice

coil_fitter: uses ROOT tminuit to find coils that can be used to "mimic" fields from field_models

gauss_minimiser: I was experimenting with some genetic algorithm stuff. It is not used.

movie.py: small script to drive mencoder (and ffmpeg)

final_cooling_match: uses ROOT tminuit to do matching for the final cooling lattice
